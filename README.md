# Scripts and Dots
[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](/LICENSE)

I spend too much time copy pasting scripts and reconfiguring various tools from system to system. This repo exists as a point for me to keep all my public facing scripts and configs.

## Getting Started

1. To get up and running clone the repo.
1. Next, add any configs or scripts you don't want to the `dots/ignore` or `scripts/ignore` file.
1. Run `setup.sh` to
	- symbolically link all the dotfiles to your home directory.
	- Add a line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` that will source aliases for all the scripts.

## Scripts
